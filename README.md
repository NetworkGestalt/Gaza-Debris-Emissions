[Estimating Carbon Emissions from Processing Building Debris in Gaza](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383876523_Estimating_Carbon_Emissions_from_Processing_Building_Debris_in_Gaza) 
 (Abdelnour & Roy).

> **Abstract:**
> 
> The debris from destroyed and damaged buildings is a material representation of the unprecedented human, infrastructural, and environmental devastation resulting from the bombardment of Gaza. Removing, transporting, and processing the immense quantity of building debris will have a significant impact on Gaza’s physical infrastructure and environment, while also representing a considerable portion of military-related carbon emissions. We estimate the carbon emissions arising from transporting building debris to nearby disposal sites, and from crushing uncontaminated concrete rubble into finer aggregates for reuse.

## Contents:

1. **[QGIS-Data](https://github.com/NetworkGestalt/Gaza-Debris-Carbon-Emissions/tree/main/QGIS-Data):** GeoPackage databases (.gpkg) containing the spatial datasets used for the project's estimations. To keep file sizes small, some GeoPackages have been split and compressed into separate ZIP files.
   - **[building-footprints](https://github.com/NetworkGestalt/Gaza-Debris-Carbon-Emissions/tree/main/QGIS-Data/building-footprints):** Microsoft building footprints, UNOSAT damage classification points, and building footprints matched to nearby UNOSAT damage points.
   - **[building-height](https://github.com/NetworkGestalt/Gaza-Debris-Carbon-Emissions/tree/main/QGIS-Data/building-height):** Average Net Building Height (ANBH) raster from the European Commission's Global Human Settlement (GHS) dataset, building storey count points from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) service8 repository, and building footprints matched to nearby PCBS storey points.
   - **[shortest-paths](https://github.com/NetworkGestalt/Gaza-Debris-Carbon-Emissions/tree/main/QGIS-Data/shortest-paths):** Contains Origin-Destination (OD) matrices that encode the shortest paths from every damanged building to each of the five disposal sites proposed by UNEP, following Gaza's 2021 road network. Also includes vector (line) layers of the shortest path for each building to the nearest disposal site.
   - **[debris-heatmap](https://github.com/NetworkGestalt/Gaza-Debris-Carbon-Emissions/blob/main/QGIS-Data/debris-heatmap):** Contains GeoPackage database of centroids of matched footprints (for each damage class), used in the Kernel Density Estimation (weighted by log tonnes of debris) of the debris heatmap. The resulting heatmap is also included as a Raster subdivided into three files. 
   
2. **[Images](https://github.com/NetworkGestalt/Gaza-Debris-Carbon-Emissions/tree/main/Images):** Collection of images (.png and .jpg), including those featured in the report and additional images excluded for brevity.
   
3. **[Scripts](https://github.com/NetworkGestalt/Gaza-Debris-Carbon-Emissions/tree/main/Scripts):** Text files (.txt) containing Python code that we found to be useful during the estimation process. These include short scripts that extract the shortest paths from the OD matrices, and for filtering building footprints that are matched to several overlapping PCBS storey count points by computing their average.
